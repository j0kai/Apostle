# Apostle Engine
The Apostle Engine is a 2D/3D game engine in the early stages of development. The engine currently doesn't support platforms other than Windows and is exclusively using OpenGL as it's graphics API, as I figured that it would be the easiest to get up-and-running.

# Getting Started

Visual Studio 2022 is recommended (however, VS2017 and onwards ___should___ work); other development environments have not been tested due to me wanting to get Apostle running on a Windows build initially.

Furthermore, due to the way that the project is currently set up, there are a few steps you need to follow to get the project up and running:

1) Open the 'scripts' folder and run ___Win-GenerateProjects.bat___ and then open Apostle.sln

2) And with that you're ready to go! (NOTE: Hit F5 to see the example.)
